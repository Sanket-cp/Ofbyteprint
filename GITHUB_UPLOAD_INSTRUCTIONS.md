# GitHub Upload Instructions

## Your project is ready to upload to GitHub! Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a new repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository: `printify-hub` or `printhub-website`
5. Add description: "Professional printing services website with enhanced animations and Arc Prints style design"
6. Keep it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect your local repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

### Step 3: Alternative - Upload via GitHub Web Interface
If you prefer using the web interface:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag and drop all your project files
4. Add commit message: "Initial commit: PrintHub website with enhanced animations"
5. Click "Commit changes"
